prom.exe will work with any FLASH / image size. Please note, that you can and should adjust the read bytesize inside the Arduino sketch to your liking.

Having installed 'g++' on your system (instructions see below), compile with

	g++ main.cpp -oprom.exe -Os -s

or just type 'make' if you have installed it. Done.

  pacman -Syu (close & reopen terminal)								// -S: search, y: refresh package information, u: update installed packages
  pacman -Syu																					// --needed: only installs packages that are not yet installed
  pacman -S --needed mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc make nano		// -R: removes package, -Q: querries if package is installed
- Windows Search: system environment variables / Path = c:\msys2\mingw64\bin;c:\msys2\mingw32\bin;c:\msys2\usr\bin
